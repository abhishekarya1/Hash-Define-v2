## SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Always case-insensitive (even table and attributes names)
- Semicolon `;` to indicate command termination are _mandatory_ in MySQL terminal
- Use `--` for single-line comment
- `/* */` (multi-line commnents)
- Declarative language

### Glossary 
- **Relation** (Table)
- **Attribute** & **Field** (Column), **Degree** (no. of attributes)
- **Tuple** & **Record** (Row), **Cardinality** (no. of tuples)
- **Projection** (subset of columns displayed as the final output)

### Types of Commands
- DDL (create, alter, truncate) (modifies schema)
- DML (insert, delete, update) (modifies table data)
- DCL (grant, revoke)
- DQL (select)
- TCL (begin, commit, savepoint, rollback)

### Storage Engines
https://www.mysqltutorial.org/understand-mysql-table-types-innodb-myisam.aspx

The internal engine that runs stuff and we can leverage many features of different engines available. We can also specify a different engine to use for different tables.

A total of 9 storage engines are available in MySQL. Postgres has only 1.

Default is: **InnoDB**

### Logging into the MySQL Server
```sh
$ mysql -u username -p
Enter Password: ******** 
```

### Databases
```sql
CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] db_name;
DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] db_name;

SHOW DATABASES;

USE db_name;
```

#### Importing an external DB
`SOURCE c:\path\to\db_name.sql`

### Data Types
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mysql/mysql-data-types.htm

### CREATE TABLE

```sql
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] table_name(
   column_1_definition,
   column_2_definition,
   ...,
   table_constraints
) ENGINE=storage_engine;
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee(
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
emp_name VARCHAR(50),
doj DATE,
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE t_name(
serial_no INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, -- PRIMARY KEY (alternatively)
emp_id INT NOT NULL,
emp_name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
doj DATE,
PRIMARY KEY (emp_id)    --single column only, multiple => CONSTRAINT combined_pk_alias PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName)
);
```

#### CREATE TABLE AS
```sql
CREATE TABLE TestTable AS
SELECT customername, contactname
FROM customers;
```
(\*Creating one table from another by projection, this copies row data too)
```sql
CREATE TABLE emp1 AS
SELECT * FROM emp 
WHERE 1=2;  --false condition; no data from where clause
```
(\*Copying only the schema)

### DROP TABLE 
`DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] t_name, t2_name;` or simply `DROP TABLE t_name;`
(delete data as well as schema)

### TRUNCATE
`TRUNCATE TABLE t_name;`
(delete all data but keep schema)

### DESCRIBE
`DESCRIBE table_name;` 
(display the schema of the table)

### ALTER TABLE
```sql
ALTER TABLE t_name
ADD c_name varchar(10)
[ FIRST | AFTER column_name],
ADD c2_name varchar(100)
[ FIRST | AFTER column_name];
```
```sql
ALTER TABLE t_name
MODIFY c_name varchar(20),
MODIFY c2_name varchar(90);
```
```sql
ALTER TABLE t_name
CHANGE COLUMN old_name new_name
[ FIRST | AFTER column_name];
```
```sql
ALTER TABLE t_name
DROP COLUMN c_name;
```
```sql
ALTER TABLE t_name
RENAME TO new_t_name;
```

In Postgres, `MODIFY` isn't avaialble but `RENAME COLUMN`, `ADD COLUMN`, `ALTER COLUMN` are. Differs slightly based on different providers.

### RENAME TABLE
`RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;`

(\*for renaming temporary tables use ALTER TABLE RENAME TO)

### INSERT INTO
```sql
INSERT INTO t_name(attrib1, attrib2, ... attribN)
VALUES
(v11,v12,...), 
(v21,v22,...), 
... 
(vnn,vn2,...);

-- No need to specify attribute list if filling all attributes:
INSERT INTO t_name VALUES (value1, value2, ... valueN);
```

### SELECT
```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] Attribute_List FROM T1,T2â€¦TM
[WHERE condition1 [AND/OR... condition2]]
[GROUP BY (Attributes)[HAVING condition]]
[ORDER BY(Attributes)[ASC/DESC]];
```

(Uses `ASC` by default)

**Operators in WHERE** <br>
   - **Relational** (=, !=, <, >, <=, >=) <br>
   - condition1 **AND/OR/NOT** condition2 ... and so on.. <br>
   - **LIKE/NOT LIKE** `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE 's%';` (`%` = \*, `_` = .) Case-insensitive`ILIKE` also available in Postgres. Escape sequences can also be used `LIKE '__\%'`, matches `99%` <br>

   - **BETWEEN, NOT BETWEEN** `SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price BETWEEN 50 AND 60;` <br>
   - **IN/NOT IN** `SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City IN ('Paris','London');` (Ex - `IN (subquery)`) <br>
   - **IS NULL/IS NOT NULL** `SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;` <br> 

### REGEXP
```sql
SELECT first_name FROM person_tbl WHERE first_name REGEXP '^a.*';
```

### LIMIT / OFFSET
It limits the result-set (`WHERE` clause's output) which may or may not be the final output (projection).

```sql
SELECT field1, field2,...fieldN 
FROM table_name1, table_name2...
[WHERE Clause]
[LIMIT N] [OFFSET M ]
```

```sql
SELECT field1, field2,...fieldN 
FROM table_name1, table_name2...
[WHERE Clause]
LIMIT [offset_value,] limit_value
```

```sql
select long_w from station 
where lat_n > 38 order by lat_n asc limit 1;

-- selects long_w for a (single) smallest lat_n greater than 38
```

### FETCH
Same effect as `OFFSET` and `LIMIT`. Requires `ORDER BY` clause in order to to get consistent output. No commas just like `LIMIT OFFSET`.
```sql
ORDER BY foo,   -- required
OFFSET m {ROW | ROWS}
FETCH [FIRST | NEXT] n {ROW | ROWS} ONLY;
```

### UPDATE
```sql
UPDATE table_name 
SET field1 = value1, 
field2 = value2
[WHERE Clause]
```
### DELETE FROM
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name 
[WHERE Clause]
```
### Aggregate & Scalar Functions

#### Aggregate Functions
They take as input, a collection of values and return a single scalar value.

- **MIN(), MAX()** `SELECT MIN(marks_maths) FROM RESULT-2020 WHERE BATCH='OP1'`
    ```sql
    SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
    FROM Products; 
    ```
- **COUNT(), AVG(), SUM()**

Of all the aggregate methods, only `COUNT()` doesn't ignore `NULL` values. 

#### Scalar Functions
They also return a single scalar value based on some input that can be a collection of values.
```sql
LEN()    LCASE()    UCASE()    MID()    CONCAT()    RAND()    ROUND()    NOW()    FORMAT()
```

### Arithmetic Operations
```sql
SELECT name, price * 0.25 from items;
SELECT name, ROUND(price - (price * 0.25), 2) from items;   -- scale = 2, ROUND(expr, scale)

SELECT name, ROUND(price - (price * 0.25), 2) AS discounted_price from items;   -- aliasing column
```

### COALESCE(), NULLIF(), CAST()
```sql
-- COALESCE: returns first non-null value from the left among the arguments
SELECT COALESCE(null, null, 1, 10) from customers;      -- 1
SELECT COALESCE(is_smoker, 'No') from customers;

-- NULLIF: returns NULL if both the arguments are equal otherwise left arg
NULLIF(9, 9)
NULLIF (1, 0); -- returns 1
NULLIF ('A', 'B'); -- returns A

-- CAST
CAST('2022-06-23' AS DATE)
CAST('78' AS INTEGER)
CAST('8.99' AS DOUBLE)
```

### ALIAS

```sql
# Column Aliases
SELECT price AS cost FROM table;

SELECT price cost FROM table;        -- ommitting AS
```

```sql
# Table Aliases
SELECT item, price FROM table AS t;

SELECT item, price FROM table t;     -- ommitting AS
```

### GROUP BY 
Used in conjunction with aggregate functions. To group their results together based on a particular column.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country    -- count() is grouped; otherwise it would not have been
```
(\*we can skip `Country` from projection but that doesn't make any sense)

### HAVING
The `WHERE` clause places conditions on the selected table columns, whereas the `HAVING` clause places conditions on groups (query result columns) created by the `GROUP BY` clause or aggregate functions. We can't have a `HAVING` clause without a `GROUP BY` clause.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING Country = 'USA';
```

### ORDER BY
Orders by any column(s). It sorts the result-set (`WHERE` clause's output) and not the final projection, thus the columns in `ORDER BY` clause need not be present in the final projection attribute list.
```sql
select long_w from station 
where lat_n < 137 order by lat_n desc limit 1;

-- gets the (single) maximum lat_n less than 137 and displays corresponding long_w
```

### Subqueries
We can have simple subqueries, correlated subqueries, and use subqueries with `EXISTS/NOT EXISTS`, `IN/NOT IN`, `ANY/ALL` clauses.

```sql
-- subquery in projection
SELECT atribute1, attribute2, (subquery) FROM demo;

-- select from subquery; aka derived table
SELECT atribute1, ..., attributeN FROM (subquery) AS subquery_alias;
-- alias is mandatory as because everything in the FROM clause must have a name
```
```sql
-- simple subquery
SELECT 
    employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees)

-- correlated subquery
SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    first_name, 
    last_name
FROM
    employees e
WHERE
    NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM dependents d
    WHERE d.employee_id = e.employee_id)    -- parent table alias used here; correlation
```

### EXISTS
The `EXISTS` operator returns true if the subquery returns one or more records, else false.
```sql
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);
```
### ANY, ALL
They are used to compare a single column to a set of columns from subquery output.

**ANY**: compares current column and _any_ value in subquery output. `SOME` is an alias for this clause.

**ALL**: compares current column and _all_ values in subquery output.

```sql
SELECT ProductName 
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);

-- lists productIDs in Products table which are equal to any one ProductID in OrderDetails table
```

```sql
SELECT ProductName 
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID < ALL (SELECT ProductID FROM OrderDetails WHERE Quantity = 10);

-- lists productIDs in Products table which are less than all ProductIDs in OrderDetails table
```

### SELECT INTO
Insert attributes into new table from an existing one.
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM oldtable
WHERE condition;
```

```sql
SELECT * 
INTO newtable
FROM oldtable
WHERE 1=2;
```
(\* Copying shema only into an empty table)

### INSERT INTO SELECT
Insert data from matching corresponding attributes from one table to another.
```sql
INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition;
```
### CASE
```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1    -- notice no comma separator
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE default_result
END

-- another way
CASE(expr)
    WHEN value_of_expr1 THEN result1
    WHEN value_of_expr2 THEN result2
    WHEN value_of_exprN THEN resultN
    ELSE default_result
END
```
```sql
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;

CASE(animal_name)
    WHEN 'Dolphin' THEN 'Mammal'
    WHEN 'Shark' THEN 'Fish'
    WHEN 'Snake' THEN 'Reptile'
    ELSE 'Unspecified'
END
```

### Set Operations: UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, MINUS 
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION / UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```
(\* `UNION ALL` keeps duplicate tuples whereas `UNION` does not)

- Each SELECT statement under UNION must have the **same number of columns**
- The columns must also have **similar data types**
- The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the **same order**

```sql
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country = 'Germany'
ORDER BY City;	--applies to whole union-ed table
```

**MINUS**: `query1 MINUS query2` (All rows in `query1` which are not in `query2`). Alias for this clause is `EXCEPT` in Postgres.

### JOINS

{{<mermaid>}}
graph TB;
    A[Type of Joins]
    A --> B(INNER)
    A --> C(Outer Joins)
    A --> D(CROSS)
    C --> E(LEFT)
    C --> F(RIGHT) 
    C --> G(FULL)
{{< /mermaid >}}

**EQUI JOIN**: Any of the above joins that performs join based on equality `=`  of two columns, each in either table. Ex - `A.x = B.y`

**NATURAL JOIN**: A type of `EQUI JOIN` where column names are exactly the same. Ex - `A.x = B.x`

**SELF JOIN**: Join that is performed on a single table on itself. Two columns from the same table are used to perform join.

A `FOREIGN KEY` is automatically created in a `JOIN` if a suitable candidate is not present.

#### INNER JOIN
When table A(1,2,3,4) and table B(3,4,5,6) are inner-joined, the output will be (3,4). We can join more than two tables too. We join based on some column(s) from each table to match data.

It is basically _**intersection**_ set operation.

```sql
SELECT a
FROM A
INNER JOIN B ON b = a;

-- three tables
SELECT A.n
FROM A
INNER JOIN B ON B.n = A.n
INNER JOIN C ON C.n = A.n;
```

#### Outer Joins
##### LEFT JOIN
```sql
SELECT A.n
FROM A
LEFT JOIN B ON B.n = A.n;
```

Display full table on the left but places `NULL` on values not in Right table.

##### RIGHT JOIN
```sql
SELECT A.n
FROM A
RIGHT JOIN B ON B.n = A.n;
```

Display full table on the right but places `NULL` on values not in Left table.

##### FULL [OUTER] JOIN
```sql
SELECT A.n
FROM A
FULL [OUTER] JOIN B ON B.n = A.n;
```

Display entries from both the tables but places `NULL` on values not in each other.

#### CROSS JOIN
It is cartesian product `m x n rows` of two tables so **_no predicate_** is required. 

It is equivalent of doing `INNER JOIN` with condition as `true` since there is no predicate.

```sql
-- all of the below are equivalent

SELECT select_list
FROM T1
CROSS JOIN T2;

SELECT select_list
FROM T1, T2;

SELECT *
FROM T1
INNER JOIN T2 ON true;
```

![](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/PostgreSQL-CROSS-JOIN-illustration.png)

#### Other Joins
```sql
SELECT select_list FROM T1
NATURAL [INNER, LEFT, RIGHT] JOIN T2;

SELECT * FROM city
NATURAL JOIN country;

SELECT * FROM products
INNER JOIN categories USING (category_id);
```

### TCL
```sql
BEGIN;      -- begin a transaction

COMMIT;     -- cannot rollback to a point after a commit

SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name;
ROLLBACK;   -- rolls back to latest savepoint; or latest commit
```

### SQL Constraints
Around 9 constraints are listed below.

- **PRIMARY KEY** (Not Null + Unique)
```sql
CREATE TABLE demo(
id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,	--column level since single PK
name varchar(20)
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE demo(
id int,
name varchar(20),
PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE demo(
name varchar(20),
id int NOT NULL,
[CONSTRAINT key_alias] PRIMARY KEY(name, id) 		--table level since multiple PK, single also allowed
);
```

- **FOREIGN KEY**: (Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table i.e. it is Primary Key of some other table and doesn't have to be unique in current table)

```sql
PersonID int FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)       -- column level

FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)         -- table level; same effect as above

CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)   -- same but uses CONSTRAINT keyword; table level 
```

- **UNIQUE**
- **NOT NULL**
- **CHECK** (Ensures that all values satisfy a specific condition)
 `CHECK(salary >= 3)` 
```sql
Age int CHECK(Age >= 18)       -- column level; single column check

CONSTRAINT CHK_Person CHECK (Age >= 18 AND City = 'Seattle')   -- table level; multiple column check
```
- **DEFAULT** (Sets a default value for a column when no value is specified)
  `DEFAULT "John Doe"`
- **INDEX**
- **ENUM** or **SET** (Only values in enum or set are allowed)

```sql
CREATE TABLE t_name (
    col1 int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    col2 varchar(255) DEFAULT 3,
    col3 varchar(255),
    col4 int,
    
);
```

#### ALTER TABLE to apply Constraints later
```sql
ALTER  TABLE demo 
ADD PRIMARY KEY(id);

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CHECK (Age >= 18);

ALTER TABLE demo
DROP PRIMARY KEY;
```

### Auto-increment, Sequences, Identity
```sql
id int AUTO_INCREMENT   -- MySQL; column level

id int SERIAL   -- Postgres; column level

-- we can also create a sequence and SERIAL uses sequence internally with step = 1, init val = 0

-- Identity colummn is also provided in Postgres which also uses sequences internally

```

### Built-in Functions
- `left(str, n)` and `right(str, n)`: Substringing from left and right respectively.
- `round(expr, scale)`: Rounding decimal
- `abs(expr)`: Returns absolute value
- `pow(expr, exponent)`: Raise expression to exponent power

### GROUPING SETS, ROLLUP, CUBE
We often group aggregate methods using `GROUP BY` and specify columns to group onto. All three are alternate syntax to avoid writing complex `GROUP BY` and manually perform `UNION ALL` on queries.
```sql
-- GROUP BY with UNION ALL
SELECT count(*) FROM employees GROUP BY first_name;
UNION ALL
SELECT count(*) FROM employees GROUP BY last_name;
UNION ALL
SELECT count(*) FROM employees;

-- equivalent query using GROUPING SETS; we can specify sets to group by inside parentheses
SELECT count(*) FROM employees
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ( 
    first_name, 
    last_name, 
    () 
);
-- () means no gouping (it will return count(*) for the whole table)

-- another example with composite grouping sets; equivalent to ROLLUP
SELECT count(*) FROM employees
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ( 
    (first_name, last_name),
    (first_name),
    (last_name),
    ()
);
```
```sql
-- ROLLUP
SELECT count(*) FROM employees
GROUP BY ROLLUP ( first_name, last_name );
-- shows result of group by none, group by all 3, group by 2, group by just 1 

-- CUBE
SELECT count(*) FROM employees
GROUP BY CUBE ( first_name, last_name );
-- shows result of group by for all combinations (2^n power set) 
```

_References_: [Working with Rollups and Cubes in SQL](https://youtu.be/KLPULneM4mo)

### CTE (Common Table Expression)
CTE allow us to  create a temporary table and perform query on it. The table is destoryed as soon as the query is finished executing.

```sql
-- syntax
WITH cte_name [(column_list)] AS (
    CTE_query 
)
query;

-- example 
WITH cte_film AS (
    SELECT film_id, title    
    FROM film
    WHERE release_year <= 2000
)
SELECT film_id, title
FROM  cte_film        -- notice
WHERE genre = 'Sci-Fi';
```

We could have acheived this with subqueries too.

### Views
They are used to create a separate data stucture which we can query instead of directly querying on tables.

A view **can have attributes from multiple tables**, so instead of running a complex `JOIN` query, we can create a view and simply query that.

They differ from CTE or subqueries is that an actual physical object is created and stored whose scope is even beyond that of query.
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS query;

-- query can be any JOIN query that outputs a projection having columns from multiple tables
-- when we query a View, we are effectively querying this complex JOIN query's output
```
We can also `UPDATE` and `DROP` views too just like regular tables.
