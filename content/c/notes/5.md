## Memory Management

### Memory Layout
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/memoryLayoutC.jpg)

```txt
stack: funtion call stack, local variables

heap: dynamically allocated data objects

initialized data: global or static variables (initialized)
uninitialized data: global or static variables (uninitialized) a.k.a BSS (block started by symbol)

text: stores source code
```
```c
// use size command to get memory layout
> size test.exe
```
### Dynamic Allocation Fucntions
[Reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)

- `<stdlib.h>` functions: returns pointer to allocated block or `NULL`.

1. **malloc():** memory allocation, fills with garbage
```c
Syntax: void* malloc(size_t size)

Usage: int* p = (int*) malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
```

2. **calloc():** continuous allocation of _n_ objects, each has `0`
```c
Syntax: void* calloc(n, size_t size)

Usage:int* p = (int*) calloc (5, sizeof(int))
```

3. **realloc():** Reallocates memory block of a previously allocated block
```c
Syntax: void* realloc(void* p, size_t size)

Usage:int* pNew = (int*) realloc (p, 10 * sizeof(int)) 		// more memory was allocated, may not start from the same location
```

4. **free():** frees memory. Takes only one argument (pointer) since above functions implicitly store size information that `free()` can read.
```c
free(p);
```
Avoids memory leaks.

#### Tips
- `calloc()` is just `malloc()` followed by `memset()` to `0`
- we can free allocated memory by `free()` or by `realloc(0, size)`
- the above two are equivalent in outcome but not at all interchangeable because of optimization and surprises.

- Other functions

1. **memset():** originally made for setting characters but can be used to set memory to **only 0**.
```c
Syntax: void memset(void* ptr, int c, size_t size)

Usage: memset(arr, 0, sizeof arr);
```

## File Management
A file is always terminated by an `EOF` character. And file functions check for this character often.

### Operations
```c
To open a file: fopen(const char* filename, const char* mode)
To read a file: fscanf() or fgets()
To write to a file: fputs() or fprintf()
To close a file: fclose(FILE* fp)

// Returns NULL if erorr
```

```c
Checking end of file (returns non-zero value only if EOF is reached): int feof(FILE* fp)

Return file pointer position: long ftell(FILE* fp)

Going to specific position in file: void rewind(FILE* fp)
									int fseek(FILE *fp, long int offset, int whence)
										whence constants = SEEK_SET (beginning of file)	
														   SEEK_CUR (current position of file pointer)
														   SEEK_END  (end of file)

Set file pointer position: int fsetpos(FILE *fp, const fpos_t *position)


Rename file: int rename (const char *old_name, const char *new_name)

Remove file: int remove(FILE* fp)

Create temporary files: FILE *tmpfile(void) 
// Perform file operations on it and closes automatically, no need to use fclose()
// rewind() can't tell if operation was a success or otherwise
```

### fget/fput functions
```c
int fgetc(FILE *pointer)
int fputc(int char, FILE *pointer)

char* fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream)		//safer than gets() since it specifies maximum number of characters to be read
char* gets (char *str)
```

### File Writing Modes
![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tP1rI.png)
- Exclusive create-and-open mode (**wx**): `fopen()` returns `NULL` if file already exists or could not open.
