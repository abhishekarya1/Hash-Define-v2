## Data Types

```c
// Primitive
int 		012(octal)    0xFB(hex)		 
float		double 		  long double
char
bool (from <stdbool.h>)

signed	unsigned   //(for "char" and "int" types only)
short		long 			long long 

// Derived
arrays, enum, union, struct


// Pointers
int*
void (only pointers and function return type)
etc...


/* Literal Suffixes (Case-insensitive)
int = u, l, ll
real = f, l
*/
```

### Need for long type
Systems that used 16-bits to store integer values continued using the same amount even on 32-bit systems where Memory Address Register (MAR) is larger and hence can address more locations than on a 16-bit storage, we needed a type that can be utilized depending on machine architecture, hence `long` came into existence.


### Modifier Rules
- If no data type is specified, it is always `int` by default.
```c
static a = 7;
signed b = 8;
const c = 9;
```

- `int` and `char` are always `signed` by default.

- No modifiers for `float` are allowed.

- Only modifier allowed on `double` is `long double`.

### Type Casting and Integer Promotions
**Explicit Cast:** Higher data type to lower one. `float` to `int` (often leads to truncate or loss of data).

```c
//Explicit conversion syntax

(int)a

(float) 9/5

(unsigned int) 4.3 - 2

1.141f	1.141F
```

**Implicit Cast:** Lower data type to higher one. `signed` to `unsigned` (performed by compiler implicitly).

```c
//Very famous pitfall
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(){
   float c = 5.0;
   printf ("Temperature in Fahrenheit is %.2f", (9/5)*c + 32);
   return 0;
}

//Output: 37.0

//Fix: make any one of 9 or 5 as double
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(){
   float c = 5.0;
   printf ("Temperature in Fahrenheit is %.2f", (9.0 / 5)*c + 32);
   return 0;
}

//Output: 41.0
```


**Integer Promotions:** Integer data types like `char` and `enum` can be promoted to `int` or `unsigned`.

### 2s Complement 
![](https://images.slideplayer.com/31/9715344/slides/slide_24.jpg)

- It is totally a "hack", entirely observation based, no first principles. It always works!
- We need to represent _negative_ numbers too in those bit patterns only and we do so by not touching the _positive_ numbers (whose MSB is `0`) and taking their _2s complement_ as negative numbers.
- We get only one representation for `0` (that's good), and we also get a number `2 ^ (n)` (where `n` is number of bits we are using to represent the numbers) whose both _positive_ and _negative_ representations are same, so we take it as _negative_.
- So, _positive_ numbers have MSB as `0` in their representaion and _negative_ have MSB as `1`.

### Float and Double

`float` is a 32-bit IEEE 754 _single_ precision Floating Point Number: _1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 23 for the value_, i.e. `float` has `7 decimal digits of precision`.

`double` is a 64-bit IEEE 754 _double_ precision Floating Point Number: _1 bit for the sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52 bits for the value_, i.e. `double` has `15 decimal digits of precision`.

```c
float a = .2;	//valid
float b = 2.;	//valid
```

```c
//By default every real constant in a program is double

float a = 0.1;
a == 0.1	//false, double is more precise than float

a == 0.1f	//true (f/F)

0.1l	//long double literal (l/L)

0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3	//false, non-terminating recurring decimal on RHS, LHS expression's result has limited precision 
```

### Character
`char` and `int` are interchangeable in C as `char` is internally represented as ASCII integer values from 0 to 255. The range of `char` is much less than that of `int` and hence care must be taken on casts.

### size_t
- Its size must be equal to the largest data type size on that machine, typically `unsigned long long`.
- always a positive (unsigned) number
- `sizeof()` operator returns this
- Functions like `malloc()`, `memcpy()`, etc... has arguments and `strlen()` returns this type.

## Operators

### Arithmetic
- If the size of the result lies outside the range of the type of variable we're storing it in, it'll truncate to largest value.
```c
unsigned char c;
c = 255 + 255;		//sets c = 254

//signed char c would set c as -2
```
- Division truncates often.
```c
2/3		// 0
9/5		// 1
```

- In modulo (`%`) operation, sign of the `numerator` always carries over to the result.
```c
-3 % 2  // -1

-3 % -2  // -1

2 % -3  // 1
``` 

- Division works the same as maths after C99.
```c
-3 / -1   // 3
-2 / 1	  // -2
3 / -2	  // -1
```

### Logical
- Ouput is an `int`. Either `0` or `non-zero` value.
- Can't use compound assignments with logical operators like `&&==` or `||==`.
- _Short-circuit_ logic applies to both `&&` and `||`.

```c
sizeof(x && y) 	// 4


//Short-circuiting in logical operators
foo() && bar()		// if foo() returns 0, bar() won't be called
foo() || bar() 		// if foo() returns a non-zero value, bar() won't be called
```

### Relational 
- Ouput is an `int`. Either `0` or `non-zero` value.
```c
sizeof(x == y)		// 4
```

### Bitwise 
- using them on negative numbers is undefined behaviour.
```c
-2 << 1 	//undefined
```
- shifting a number more than its number of bits is undefined behaviour.
```c
1 << 33		//undefined, if int is 32-bits
```
- `n left shifts` = `multiplication by 2 ^ n` and `n right shifts` = `division by 2 ^ n`.
- _Arithmetic shift_ preserves sign-bit (rotates all except sign-bit), whereas _logical shift_ doesn't preserve sign-bit.

### Pre and Post Unary 
- only _l-value_ must be passed as operands, no _r-value_ or even _expressions_.
```c
int a = 8;
a++;	//correct

8++;	//compile-time error

int a = 1, b= 2;
++(a+b);	 //compile-time error

++(-i);		//compile-time error
(++i)++;	//compile-time error

int t = -i;
++t;	  //correct
```
- Precedence of _postfix_ is higher than that of _prefix_.
```md
postfix           >      prefix = dereferncing

LR associative			   RL associative
```

- Return value of _pre_ and _post_ differs (obviously)
```c
int a = 8;

return a++;		//returns 8

return ++a;		//returns 9
```

- [A good question](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-p-p-and-p/): Difference between ++\*p, \*p++ and \*++p?

### Comma
Two uses: 
1. As an **operator**: act as a sequence point, lowest precedence.

```c
//As an operator it evaluates both sides starting from left, sets sewuence point after each and returns the rightmost evaluation's result

int a = (1, 2, 5, 10);		// a = 10

int b = (foo(), bar());		// a = bar()


//we can also do this:
printf("Hello"),
printf("World"),
if(a == b) { ... }
``` 

2. As a **separator**: used in function parameter separation, variable declaration, etc...
```c
int a = 1, 2, 3;	//acts as a separator as it is expected during declaration, compile-time error saying expected identifier at 2's place

int a;
a = 1, 2, 3;	//acts as an separator after setting a = 1

int a = (1, 2, 3); 		//acts as an operator and sets value as 3


return a, b, c;		//c is returned
```

- Comma as an operator can't operate on _l-values_.
```c
(a, b) = 10;	//compile-time error
```

**Sequence Points:** All side-effects (changes and computations on variables) have been finished before a sequence point. We have them naturally in `&&`, `||`, `?:`, start of loops, etc.. or we can make them using `,`. Cases such as `foo() + bar()` or `printf("%d %d", foo(), bar())` don't have any sequence points and hence we don't have a defined order of execution among operands or parameters of a function.

### Assignment
```c
//what's the return type of an assignment operation? Ans: the value it is assigning.

int a = (b = 4);	//a is set as 4

if(a = 0)	 //false
if(b = 4) 	 //true
if(c = 'c')	 //true
```
### Conditional
```c
// it has a return type and operands must have same return type (foo and bar) else suprises 
int a = (b == 1) ? foo() : bar();

a > b ? (c=10) : (d=10);	//use brackets otherwise error
```

### sizeof
- evaluated at compile-time
- returns `size_t` type
- can be applies to any primitive or aggregate type
- no expression is evaluated inside
```c
int a = 1, b = 2;

printf("%d", sizeof(a+=b));		// 4 
printf("%d", a);				// 1 
```
- brackets are optional
```c
sizeof a+b;		//valid
```

### Precedence, Associativity, and Order of Evaluation
Link: [here](/c/c-dennis-ritchie/2019-01-22-c-programming-chapter-2/#precedence-and-order-of-evaluation) 
```c
//no chaining in C, unlike Python

if(a < b < c){ ... }		//no errors

//evaluated as: (a < b) < c	
```

---

## Control Statements

### Loops
```c

for(;;); 	//valid

for(foo();foo();foo()){
	foo();
}

//TO-DO: sequence of execution in a 'for' loop
```  
- while is slightly dangerous, we may forget update clause or `continue` may appear before updation. 
- _do-while_ loop always runs atleast once.

### Switch Case
- _fall-through_ in nature, don't forget to `break;` after every case.
- `default:` is optional and its position of `default:` never matters.
- anything else inside `switch` but not in any `case` is never executed.
- case labels must be _integer literals_ or _constant expressions_ only, `int`, `char`, and `enum`.
- two case labels can't have the same values.
- range based case labels: `low ... high`, _low_ and _high_ must only be integer literals. Errors will occur if _overlapping case values_ or _high < low_.

```c
switch (var) {
	case 1:
		break;
	case 'a':
		break;
	case 'b' ... 'c':
		break;
	case 1+2:
		break;
	case 'a'||1:
		break;
	default:
		break;
	}
```
### goto, continue, and break

```c
goto label;

label: 
```

```c
continue;		

//skips current iteration in any loop as soon as it's encountered, used only with loops
```

```c
break;

//goes out of loop as soon as it is encountered, to be used only with switch and loops
```
