## Functions
```c
//Function Declaration/Prototype
int sum(int, int);
//or 
int sum(int a, int b);


//Function Definition: formal parameters
int sum(int x, int y){
	return x+y;
}


//Function Call: actual parameters (aka arguments)
sum(2, 3);


//Fun fact: The number of arguments that a function takes is called the "arity" of the function.
```

- Return type if declaration missing is **not** assumed to be `int` always. If definition appears above call then return type is inferred from definition and if it appears after function call, then `int` is assumed and it leads to type mismatch compiler-error.

- Empty parameter list in C mean that the parameter list is not specified and function can be called with _any_ number and type of parameters.

-  Every function has a return type. If a function doesnâ€™t return any value, then `void` is used as return type.
```c
void modify(struct *a){

	return;
}
```

- We can specify no return type, in this case return type is assumed depending upon the compiler.
```c
sum(int a, int b){			//valid, but not recommended
	return a+b;
}
```

-  In C, functions can return any type except _arrays_ and _functions_. We can get around this limitation by returning _pointer to array_ or _pointer to function_.

### Parameter Passing Modes
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/parameter-passing-techniques-in-c-cpp/

- Everything in C is _pass by value_ but we send address of local variables of callee function so that we can change them from called function.
- Pass by value creates a _deep copy_ of the variable passed.
- Arrays are always passed using pointers in C. (since its costly to create copy of array, so we send its address and store it a new callee local pointer variable)

### Static Functions
Access to static functions is restricted to the file where they are declared i.e. external linkage is restricted for functions declared as static.
```c
static int sum(int a, int b){
	return a+b;
}
```

### Variadic Functions
Implemented using `<stdarg.h>`. 

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdarg.h>

int sum(int arg_count, ...) {	//first parameter must be count of arguments and ellipses (...)
	int sum = 0;

	va_list args;		//list type

	va_start(args, arg_count);		//must be called before accessing va_arg

	for (int i = 0; i < arg_count; ++i)
	{
		sum += va_arg(args, int);		//access. EVERYTIME its called, it fetches next element (be careful in min/max functions)
	}

	va_end(args);		//must be called at the ends

	return sum;
}

int main()
{
	printf("%d", sum(4, 1, 2, 3, 4));		//first parameter must be count of arguments
}
```
### Callback Functions
Callbacks are functions that takes as parameter another function and call it. Implemented using function pointers.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

void A()
{
	printf("I am function A\n");
}

// callback function
void B(void (*ptr)())
{
	(*ptr) (); 	// callback to A
}

int main()
{
	void (*ptr)() = &A;
	
	// calling function B and passing
	// address of the function A as argument
	B(ptr);

return 0;
}

```

### exit(), abort(), and assert()

- `void exit(int status_code)`: code is returned to OIS. it can range from 0-255 and _code % 256_ if code is larger than 255. Deletes temp files, closes stream buffers. `_Exit()` doesn't perform any cleanup tasks.

- `void abort(void)`: raises SIGABRT and quits program if no abort handler is defined. Doesn't delete temp files and doesn't close any open buffers.

- `void assert(int expression)`: sends expression, filename and line number to _stderr_ and then calls _abort()_ if false, otherwise nothing.
```c
assert(x == 2);
```

### Nested Functions
Not supported in C. We can define functions inside other functions, but can access only the ones in the same scope.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("main ");

	int a = 9;
	int fun() {
		printf("%d", a);
	}

	fun();
}

//Output: main 9
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
	printf("Main");
	int fun()
	{
		printf("fun");

		// defining view() function inside fun()
		int view()
		{
			printf("view");
		}
	}
	view();			//can't call because definition is not in same scope, compiler-error
}
```


## Pointers
Variables that store memory address of other variables.
- type of pointer depends upon target data type whose address they store
- type can also be `void` i.e `void*`
- `sizeof` on them is compiler-dependent, also it doesn't depend on the type whose address they store

```c
//decalaring a pointer
int *a;
int* a;
int * a;

//assigning address to a pointer
int b;
int* a = &b;

int* c;		//uninitialized pointers are dangerous as they have garbage values
```

### Operations on Pointers
```c
/* <--- on pointers ---> */
-
++, --


/* <--- on integer constants and pointers ---> */
+, +=
-, -=
```

- Minus(`-`) on pointers is useful to calculate memory between two elements in array which can then be divided by size of each element to get total number of elements between those two addresses

- **Dereferencing** (`*`): Getting value at the address the pointer stores.
```c
int b = 9;
int *a = &b;

printf("%d %d", a, *a);

//Output: 6553288 9
```

### Double Pointer

```c
int a = 8;
int* b = &a;
int **c = &b;
```
```txt
      c 		        b	           a
  _________		    _________	      ___	
 | 0xaddrB |  -->  | 0xaddrA |  -->  | 8 |
 |_________|       |_________|       |___|

```

### Dangling, Void, Null, and Wild Pointers

```
int* a;		// wild pointer

int* a = NULL; 	// null pointer
```

**NULL:** `NULL` macro is defined as `((void *)0)` in header files of most of the C compiler implementations. But C standard is saying that `0` is also a null pointer constant. It means that the following is also perfectly legal as per standard:
```c
int * ptr = 0;
```

**void Pointers:** No dereferencing (\*) is allowed and no pointer arithmetic is allowed.
```c
void *a = NULL;
```

**Dangling Pointers:** If the variable to which pointer points to goes out of scope or memory block is deallocated, it is undefined behaviour.

### const Pointers
```c
//Difference between these?
const int *p, 
int *const p, 
const int *const p


//Up qualification and Down qualification
int a = 8;
const int b = 9;

int *x = &b;		 // down: const made as int [WARNING]
const int *y = &a;	 // up: int made as const
```

### Function Pointers
They point to executable code's start address and not some memory location unlike normal pointers, but function like normal pointers in all aspects.

```c
int sum(int a, int b){
	return a+b;
}

int main(){

	int (*f)(int, int) = sum;		// since definition already present, or &sum 

	f(2, 3);		// 5
}
```
### Pointers and Arrays
- arrays are implemented using pointers, but array type is different than pointer type.
```c
arr[3]
//becomes
*(arr + 3)

arr[2][3]
//becomes
*(*(arr + 3) + 4)

5[arr] 
//becomes
*(arr + 5)
```

- array names convert to `const` pointers internally and represent address of the first element in array
```c
int arr[] = {0};

arr == &arr[0]	  // true
```

### Pointer Pitfalls
- declaration along with other type
```c
int *a, b;		// a is pointer, b is int
```
- no implicit conversion of `void*`
```c
void* p = NULL;
int a = 8;
p = &a;				// error
```
- pointers can only be initialized with `0` (among decimal values)
```c
int *a = 0;		//valid
int *b = 9;  	//invalid
```
- in function pointers, we can use function name in assignment to pointer _only if_ definition is done prior to such assignment.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

	int (*f)(int, int) = sum;		// error, use &sum

	printf("%d", f(2, 3));	
}

int sum(int a, int b){
	return a+b;
}
```

## Input-Ouput (I/O)

### Formatted I/O

`printf()`: Returns the total number of characters printed.

```c
printf("%d", printf("Hi"));		// Hi2

char * a = "hi";
char* b = "yoi";
printf("%d", printf("%s%s", a, b));		// hiyoi5	
```

`scanf()`: Returns total number of inputs scanned succesfully.

```c
char *a, *b;
printf("%d", scanf("%s %s", &a, &b));		// 2
```

### Format Specifiers

```txt
%[flags][width][.precision][length]specifier

Ex: %-3.2lld, %-.3Lf
```

[Reference](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/)

[Cheat Sheet](https://alvinalexander.com/programming/printf-format-cheat-sheet/)

**%n specifier:** stores and writes value equal to characters printed until it is encountered.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int c;
  printf("john%nwick ", &c);
  printf("%d", c);
  return 0;
}

//Output: johnwick 4
```

**\* in printf():** We can insert custom width and length values using `*`.
```c
char *s = "Hello World";
int n = 6;
printf("%.*s", n, s);

// Output: Hello
```

- In `scanf()`, `%d` and `%i` differ while they're the same for `printf()`. `%d` assumes input is given in base-10 and forces conversion and `%i` can take _hex_ and _octal_ inputs also.
```c
scanf("%d", &a);		// 12
scanf("%d", &b);		// 012
scanf("%d", &c);		//0x12
printf("a = %i, b = %i, c = %i", a, b, c);		// 12, 12, 0


scanf("%d", &a);		// 12
scanf("%i", &b);		// 012
scanf("%i", &c);		//0x12
printf("a = %i, b = %i, c = %i", a, b, c);		// 12, 10, 18
```

### Scansets

[Reference](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/scanf/)

```txt
%[scanset]specifier
```

```c
scanf("%[A-Z]s", &str);		// reads till first non A-Z character is encountered

scanf("%[^c]s", &str);		// reads till 'c' is encountered in an input
```
**\* as supression chaacter in scanf():** Reads specified characters but don't asssign them.
```c
scanf("%*d%c", &a);		// ignore integers till a character is encountered

scanf("%*s%d", &b);		// ignore string till an integer is encountered, be careful, qwerty1234 is read whole as string and scanf() ignores it whole and waits for an integer input

```

### I/O Function List

[Link](/c/gfg-c/stdio/)

#### I/O Pitfalls

- `puts()` puts `\n` by default after printing.

```c
char s[100];
gets(s);			// world
puts("hello");
puts(s);

//  hello
//	world
```
- `scanf()` stops reading at spaces and not suitable to read sentences. Use `gets()` instead.

- `scanf()` leaves `/n` in buffer and others successive functions like `gets()` can read it errorneously.
```c
scanf("%s", &a);
gets(b);

/* Input: hello
		  world

   Output: hello
		   \n
*/ 


// Fix: make scanf read a new line
scanf("%s\n", &s);
```
- constant added with a string literal as argument to `printf()`:
```c
printf(5 + "HelloWorld");	  // World

printf("%c ", 5["HelloWorld"]);		// W

printf("%c ", "HelloWorld"[5]);		// W
```
- `fflush(stdin)` after `scanf()` statement also clears the input buffer in certain compilers, it is **not recommended** to use it as it is undefined behavior by language standard.
