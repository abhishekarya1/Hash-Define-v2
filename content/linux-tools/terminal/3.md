## Commands

`echo -e` (print back to terminal)

```sh
$ echo foo bar
$ echo "foo bar"

# using escape sequences (needs quotes "")
$ echo -e "foo\nbar"
``` 

`cat` (print contents of files inorder)
```txt
$ cat fileA fileB ...

-n 		display with line numbers for all lines
```

`less` (_pager_ used for viewing text in the terminal itself)
```txt
PageUp, PageDown				turn pages
Up, Down, Left, Right arrows    navigate text
g 								jump to beginning of the text file
G 								jump to end of the text file
/searchtext 					search forwards
?searchtext						search backwards
q 								quit
h 								help
```

`head` `tail` (reading part of files)
```txt
$ head file 			(first 10 lines)
$ tail file 			(last 10 lines)

$ head -n 15 file  		(space between -n15 doesn't matter)
$ head -15 file  		(no need of -n flag)

$ head -c 20 file   	(print the first 20 characters from the file) 

$ head -n -2 file 		(print all but the last 2 lines)
$ tail -n +2 file 		(skip first two lines; print the rest)

$ tail -f file			(follows the last lines of the file in real-time update)
```

`cut` (print selected characters or fields from the file to console)
```txt
$ cut 

-c		character, starts from 1
-f		field 
-d 		specify delimiter (default is TAB)
```
```txt
$ cut -c 2 file  		(only print 2nd character of all lines)
$ cut -f 1 file
$ cut -f1 -d',' file
	
$ cut -f 2,5,7 file
$ cut -c 2,7 file
$ cut -c 5-10 file  	(both positions are included)
$ cut -c 5- file    	(from 5 till end)
$ cut -c -5 file    	(from start till 5)   
```

`tr` (translate; replace text) (waits for input, if run without a file input)
```txt
$ tr SET1 SET2

$ tr "a" "z"
$ tr "()" "[]" 					(elements of the SET1 are replaced with corresponding element from SET2)
$ tr a-z A-Z 					
$ cat file | tr a-z A-Z 		(translate and print)
$ cat file | tr a-z A-Z > file  (tr and write) (alternatively | cat > file)
$ tr -c 'a' 'z' 				(complement of set1 replaced by set2. Ex. abcd -> azzz)
$ tr -d 'a' 					(delete all of set. Ex. abcda -> bcd) 
$ tr -s [:space:] 				(squeeze multiple occurances of set into one. Ex. baaaad -> bad)
```

`sort` (default separator is not TAB but space here, specify delimited as TAB using `-t $'\t'`)
```txt
-r 				reverse sort
-n 				numerical sort, 9 > 43 in normal, but correct with sort -n
-f 				fold-case: ignore-case; both upper and lower case of a letter are equal in sort comparison
+X 				ignores first X fields, X = any number
-k n 			key; sort only on the nth field of text
-t 'char' 		use char as field delimiter (ex: -t '|')
-u				unique; show only distinct lines
-m list1 list2 	merge already sorted files; do not sort
```

`uniq` (only **_adjacent_** duplicate lines are detected unlike _sort -u_ since data here can be "unsorted")
```txt
-c 		display lines with count of occurance
-u		only unique lines
-d 		only duplicate lines
-i		ignore case
-fN		skip the first N fields in comparison
```

`rev` (reverse text)
```txt
$ echo hello | rev
olleh
```

`paste` (display lines as columns (newspaper-like) from file(s), shows corresponding lines with TAB delimiter between them by default)
```txt
$ paste file 				  equivalent to cat command
$ paste -s file 			  combine all lines in file into one, TAB separated

$ paste file1 file2 		  prints corresponding lines from both the files side-by-side on terminal

$ paste -d: file1 file2 	  custom delimiter ":" for output
$ paste -d")" file1 file2 	  other chars need double-quotes

$ paste - - < file 			  fold two adjacent lines into two columns
$ paste -d ";" - - - < file1  fold three adjacent lines into three columns
```

`expand` (convert TAB to group of spaces) (doesn't modify file in-place but prints to console)

`unexpand -a` (convert group of all spaces in file to TAB) (doesn't modify file but prints to console)


`join` (join **fields** from multiple files; based on a common field)

```sh
# joins by field = 1 by default
$ join file1 file2

# (-1 is file1.txt, -2 is file2.txt) (field 2 in file1.txt = field 1 in file2.txt)
$ join -1 2 -2 1 file1.txt file2.txt 
```
`split` (split **lines** from a file into multiple files)
```sh
# splits into different files after threshold line, default = 1000, created file name = x**
$ split file.txt

# split first 5 lines from file1.txt and files named fileaa,fileab, ... are created
$ split -l 5 file1.txt file 
```

`wc` (display the number of lines, words, and bytes respectively)
```txt
$ echo hello | wc
	1 	1 	6

-l 		only lines
-w 		only words
-c 		only bytes
-L		length of longest line in file
```

`nl` (displays line with numbers at the left side; starts with 1) (works exactly like `cat -n`)
