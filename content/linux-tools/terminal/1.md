## Commands
`pwd`

`ls -la`, `-ltrh`

`cd`

`pushd` (push a dir on top of stack and goto it)	`popd` (go back to dir on top of stack)

```sh
# in dir A

$ pushd B/C
$ popd

# in dir A again


# Shortcut: cd -
```

`touch` (update time modified/create new)

`file` (show if an object is dir or what kind of file it is)

```txt
$ file a b
a: directory
b: ASCII text
```

`mkdir -p` (_p_ flag is used to make nested dirs like `mkdir /foobar/test/mydir`)

`rmdir` (removes only _empty_ dirs; shouldn't have any subdirectories too)

`rm` (remove)
```txt
$ rm fileA fileB ...

-r	to remove dir
-f	force remove even if write protected
-i	prompt before removal of each dir
-d  remove if empty dir only
```

`cp` (copy) (overwrites by default)

```txt
$ cp fileA fileB /path_to_target_dir/...

-r	to copy dir
-i	prompt before overwrite
```

`dd` (copies contents of one file into another) (creates new if doesn't exist)
```txt
$ dd if=old_file of=new_file
```

`mv` (move, rename)  (overwrites by default) (no _r_ flag needed for dir)

```txt
$ mv fileA fileB /path_to_target_dir/...
$ mv old_name new_name

-i	prompt before overwrite
```

`tree` (print dir tree)

`find` (recursively search a file or dir)

```sh
# current dir is the deafult
$ find -name foo.txt

# by name, by type
$ find -name foo.txt -type f

# specify a dir
$ find /my/dir/ -name puppies.jpg

# empty files and dir
$ find /my/dir -empty

# multiple dir, wildcards
$ find dir1 dir2 -name *ar.png

# need quotoes in these kind of wildcards
$ find dir1 dir2 -name "*.png"

# search by path
$ find . -path "*app-logs*"

# conditionals - OR (default is AND) (-and -not are also available)
$ find . -name foo -or -type f

# case-insensitive searches (-iXXXX)
$ find -iname "fox" -ipath "*myapp*"

# by permission
$ find . -perm 700

# files greater than 3Mb
$ find . -size +3M
# files smaller than 200 bytes
$ find . -size -200c
#files greater than 3Mb but less than 500Mb
$ find . -size +3M -500M

# accessed within last 3 days
$ find . -atime -3
# modified within last 2 days
$ find . -mtime -2

# actions on search results:
# print full path
$ find / -name "myfile" -print

# delete (use with extreme caution!)
$ find / -name "myfile" -delete
```

The `find` command doesn't follow symlinks by deafult, so when we search in `/bin` it shows as empty, but `ls` shows a lot of files. Use `-L` flag with `find` command to follow symlinks.

`ln` (create links to file or dir)
```sh
# hardlink
$ ln file shortcut_file			

# softlink
$ ln -s file shortcut_file

# unlinking deletes the shortcut_file for both hard and soft links
$ unlink shortcut_file
```

## Tips

Filenames and directory names are _case-sensitive_ in Linux.

A file and a directory having _exact_ same names cannot _co-exist_ in the same directory.

`cp` and `mv` commands can't copy or move directories inside themselves.
```txt
$ cp -r a a/b
cp: cannot copy a directory, 'a', into itself, 'a/b/a'

$ mv a a/b
mv: cannot move 'a'c to a subdirectory of itself, 'a/b/a'
```

Use `cat > fileC.txt` to create a file if `fileC` is already present in the current dir since `touch` will just update it's access time.

`ls | grep <string>` can be used instead of the `find` command if the search is by file name only.


## Wildcards
Using wildcards in commands to filter files and dir is called **File globbing**. Ex - `ls *.txt`

```txt
*		 match multiple chars 
?		 match single char
[abc]	 match A or B or C
[^ab]	 match neither A nor B
[!ab]    match neither A nor B
[a-k]    match all chars from A to K
[a-z0-9] match A to Z and 0 to 9
```

```txt
$ ls *.mp3		lists all mp3 files
$ ls ?est 		lists "test", "best"

$ ls [tb]est	lists test, best
$ ls [^t]est 	lists "best" only
```
