### Line
Often used for separation, to frame, decorative, or to guide visuals. Can be formed from negative space.

### Colour
**Colour harmonies/schemas** exist to help identify colour combinations scientifically. But can be chosen based on look & feel.

**Neutral/Muted Colours**: Nothing particularly strong or any shades

**60-30-10 Rule**: 60 - primary, 30 - neutral, 10 - accent

### Shape
Can be created in a lot of ways - from solids, typography, space, etc...

### Texture
Patterns that can convey more or used to excite senses while used in repetition with bright colours.

### Space
Positive space and Negative space.

```txt
Effects applied to shapes:

Proximity
Overlap
Opacity 		- can represent levels between +ve and -ve space 
Light & Shadow 	- depth
Perspective		- relative positions, distance
```

### Form
3D - height, width, length. Can be geometric (mostly straight lines) or organic (curves).

### Typography
Can convey both visually and informatively upon reading.

**Typeface**: Style of text

**Font**: Family in a typeface sonsisting of weights and Bold, Italics, etc...

    A --> F(Proximity)
    A --> G(Repetition)

    A --> I(Function)
{{< /mermaid >}}

### Contrast
Opposing properties - size, color, etc...

### Hierarchy
Levels in properties - size, color shades, etc...

### Alignment
Positioning elements relative to each other. Along with **edges**, **centre**, **other element**.

### Balance
Symmetry, Asymmetry, Radial

### Proximity
Grouping of elements in space (guides visual)
 
### Repetition
Uniformity in elements, style, etc...

### Simplicity
Uncluttered and minimalistic.

### Function
The "why?" of it. There must be a "function" (reason to put) to all of the elements used to acheive the goal.
