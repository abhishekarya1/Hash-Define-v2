### DevOps
A set of practices combining software _development_ and IT _operations_. It aims to _shorten the development life cycle_ and provide _continuous delivery_ to customer/end-users.

**Dev** - C,B,T

**Ops** - D,O,M

**Release** ↔ **Plan**

### CI/CD

**Continuous Integration** (CI): the practice of merging all developer's code very frequently together, often in a master branch.

**Continuous Delivery** (often used for CD): approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably deployed/released at any time. Deployment to prod env is done manually (_delivering_).

**Continuous Deployment** (sometimes uesd for CD): approach in which software is deployed more often using automated deployments. Deployment to prod env is fully automated here.
